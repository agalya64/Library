Now, you have a basic library management system up and running. You can use tools like Postman or curl to interact with the API endpoints.

Here are some example API requests:

Add a new book:

Endpoint: POST http://localhost:3000/books
Body: { "title": "Book Title", "author": "Author Name", "isbn": "1234567890" }
List all books:

Endpoint: GET http://localhost:3000/books
Borrow a book:

Endpoint: PUT http://localhost:3000/books/1234567890
Body: { "action": "borrow" }
Return a book:

Endpoint: PUT http://localhost:3000/books/1234567890
Body: { "action": "return" }
Remember that this is just a simple starting point. Depending on your requirements, you may need to add more features like user authentication, a database for persistent storage, error handling, etc.
